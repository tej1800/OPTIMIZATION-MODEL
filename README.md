üìù Sample Project Description
Project Title:
Optimizing Delivery Routes for a Logistics Company Using Linear Programming

Project Description:
In this project, we solve a logistics optimization problem for a delivery company aiming to minimize transportation costs while ensuring all customer demands are met. The business has multiple warehouses and delivery locations, each with specific supply and demand values.

Using Linear Programming (LP) and the PuLP library, we formulate an optimization model where the objective is to minimize total delivery cost. The model includes constraints to ensure:

Supplies are not exceeded at warehouses

Demands are fulfilled at customer locations

Route costs are respected

Once solved, the notebook presents:

Optimal delivery routes

Total minimum cost

Resource allocation

Business insights for strategic planning

Key Concepts Covered:
Objective function formulation

Constraint modeling

Solving LP using PuLP

Business interpretation of the result
